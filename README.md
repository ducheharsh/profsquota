### Description
We all know going to a college that does not add any value to your arsenal (your skillset) just wastes our  time which can be spent more efficiently by working and upskilling ourselves, that's why we try to skip colleges however we all are bound with the inevitable **policy of minimum attendance** in college. Now to manage and calculate the minimum amount of lectures that should be attended to just make it right is now provided by Profsquota which is a Python script that helps calculate the minimum number of  lectures to be attended to just make it right.

### Inputs
1. Month and year
2. Number of lectures per weekday
3. Number of attended lectures(till now)

### Salient features
1. The calculated number of lectures excludes holidays.
2. can calculate for any month or year.

### Note:
1.  The criteria of the minimum % of attendance is set to 75 (as standard) for the program
2.  It excludes the 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month (according to some universities these days are holidays)

**You can change the configuration according to the requirements just by tweaking the code (due to its modularisation)**
